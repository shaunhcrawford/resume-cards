# Image Assets

Place your profile photo here named as `shaun.jpg`.

The photo should be:
- High resolution (at least 800x800px)
- In JPG format
- Named exactly as `shaun.jpg`

The current implementation expects the photo to be at:
`/public/images/shaun.jpg`

This will be served at runtime as:
`/images/shaun.jpg`
